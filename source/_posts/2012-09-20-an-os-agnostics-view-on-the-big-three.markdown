Now more than ever, people are becoming passionate about the OS and hardware
they run. I remember someone once tweeting about how firmware updates now
bring as much excitement as a new game or movie. That definitely rings true
for me, and it stands as a testament to just how important computers and mobile
devices have become in our daily lives.

As far as operating systems on desktops/laptops go, you're pretty much going to
see people using some variation of Windows, OSX, or Linux. These are the ones I
refer to when I say "Big Three". I have used flavors of all three in the past,
and figured it would be worthwhile to share what I have learned through my
experiences. I'll try to talk about them in a way that both techies

###Windows
Let's start with this one. Everyone's familiar with Windows. It's been the
dominant player in the market for decades now. I was just a 5 year old kid
when my dad bought our first computer. This was back in '97, and Windows 95
was still very much a cool thing. Since then, I've used XP, Vista, and 7. But
that's enough reminiscing. Here's my take on Windows:

* Great backwards compatibility. For the most part, things don't break.
* As far as gaming goes, you simply need to have Windows. Things are improving
  on both OSX and Linux, but I doubt they'll be catching up to where Windows is
  anytime soon.

##Linux
* Package managers. Seriously, these are simply amazing. Once you get some 
  command line basics down, you'll wonder how you ever lived without these.

Now that we have some comparisons out of the way, let's talk about actual usage.
For accomplishing everyday tasks, the average person can't really go wrong with
any of these three platforms.
