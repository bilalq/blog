Now more than ever, people are becoming passionate about the OS and hardware
they run. I remember someone once tweeting about how firmware updates now
bring as much excitement as a new game or movie. That definitely rings true
for me, and it stands as a testament to just how important computers and mobile
devices have become in our daily lives.

As far as operating systems on desktops/laptops go, you're pretty much going to
see people using some variation of Windows, OSX, or Linux. These are the ones I
refer to when I say "Big Three". I have used flavors of all three in the past,
and figured it would be worthwhile to share what I have learned through my
experiences. I'll try to talk about them in a way that both technophiles and
the common man can understand. Also, I will avoid bullet-points like the plague.


###Windows
Let's start with this one. Everyone's familiar with Windows. It's been the
dominant player in the market for decades now. I was just a 5 year old kid
when my dad bought our first computer. This was back in '97, and Windows 95
was still very much a cool thing. Since then, I've used XP, Vista, and 7. 

One of the things I love about Windows is that it has great backwards 
compatibility. For the most part, things don't break. Programs I ran in '95 
still run fine 7. There are exceptions to this, of course, but, that's why 
they are exceptions.

As far as gaming goes, you simply need to have Windows. Things are improving on 
both OSX and Linux, but I doubt they'll be catching up to where Windows is 
anytime soon. 

Windows 7 is great for general working productivity as well. It has tiling built
in, making the reorganization of all your open windows all within the reach of a
few keystokes. For those more accustomed to the mouse, simply dragging a window 
to an edge on the screen will magically make your windows fall in place.

Regrettably, I have not had a chance to play with Windows 8 yet. It seems like
an ambitious move from Microsoft, but it follows the pattern they seem to have 
of long release cycles with ridiculous UI paradigm changes for each generation.
I'm more interested in seeing how it will fare with tablets though, as that 
seems to be its strong suit.


##Linux
* Package managers. Seriously, these are simply amazing. Once you get some
  command line basics down, you'll wonder how you ever lived without these.

##OSX

Now that we have some comparisons out of the way, let's talk about actual usage.
For accomplishing everyday tasks, the average person can't really go wrong with
any of these three platforms. For developers, it all comes down to personal
preferences and project requirements.
